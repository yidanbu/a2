Death then typically happens at the pupal stage.\r\nAFB is serious brood disease that produces very tough spores that can survive for decades. Once a colony is infected, it will never recover. Moreover, there is no legal nor effective cure for AFB in New Zealand. Destruction is the only option because of how infectious the disease is, and how resistant the spores are.\r\nNew Zealand is one of the few countries with a nationwide control programme to eliminate AFB from the country. ','American foulbrood is a disease caused by the bacterium Paenibacillus larvae. American foulbrood (AFB) was first recorded in New Zealand in 1877 and is present in almost all countries where honey bees are found. The Chatham Islands are the only significant bee population in New Zealand that remains free from AFB.','spotty brood pattern, dead and discoloured larvae (often yellow) in uncapped cells, sometimes a strong ammonia-like smell, larvae will often rope'),(14,'pest',1,'Varroa mites','Varroa destructor (Parasitiformes: Varroidae)','Varroa mites are one of the most problematic pests of honey bees (Apis mellifera). If not controlled, varroa can seriously undermine a bee by feeding on their body tissues and enhancing transmission of bee viruses. When left unchecked, varroa can spread throughout a hive very quickly, cause parasitic mite syndrome and the eventual death of the colony.','The varroa mite (Varroa destructor) was first detected in New Zealand in 2000. It has since spread throughout the country. The Chatham Islands has the only large bee population in New Zealand that is free of this mite.','Varroa mites are oval, flat, red-brown coloured, around 1.1 mm long and 1.5 mm wide. They can be seen on adult honey bees and in the brood'),(16,'disease',1,'Nosema','Nosema','Infected bees have usually have a shortened adult lifespan. Bees infected at a young age may not produce royal jelly (brood food) and tend to skip the brood rearing stage of their life, becoming forager bees at a young age。','Nosema is a disease of honey bees. It is caused by 2 species of microsporidian parasites (a type of spore forming fungus) called Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae. Both organisms affect the honey bee’s digestive system. This causes a range of symptoms like dysentery.','Nosema is very difficult to identify because the symptoms are not specific to disease.\r\nSymptoms are related to digestive system disturbances. They are more apparent when nutrition is poor and weather conditions are cold and wet. Sometimes, dysentery is observed, the lifespan of bees are reduced and the colony dwindles in late winter or early spring '),(17,'disease',1,'Chalkbrood','Ascosphaera apis','Normally, the disease does not kill the infected colonies. However, infected colonies can be weak, have poor honey yields and are susceptible to other pests and diseases. The fungus produces highly infectious spores which can persist for many years in the environment.','Chalkbrood is a disease of honey bees caused by the fungus Ascosphaera apis. It kills the developing brood in the late larval stage producing mummified and/or calcified larvae. ','In infected colonies some larvae are covered by white fungus. This gives them a “chalky” and whiter appearance than that of healthy larvae. The brood may appear scattered with cell caps of dead larvae containing small holes and slightly flattened. Worker bees tend to uncap the cells of dead larvae, exposing mummified larvae.  Sometimes they remove the mummies from the cells and deposit them on the floor or entrance of the hive. A rattling sound may be heard when a comb is shaken gently and the mummies are still in capped cells'),(18,'disease',1,'Sacbrood','Sacbrood','The virus infects adult honey bees and larvae, but may not cause obvious symptoms in adult honey bees. Despite being so common, most honey bee colonies are able to tolerate low levels of sacbrood virus infection without suffering ill effect. ','Sacbrood is a disease caused by the sacbrood virus. It can prevent honey bee larvae from turning into pupa (and then an adult bee). The larvae die in their skin forming a sac, much like a water balloon.','Larvae are the only honey bee stage that shows obvious symptoms from sacbrood virus infection. The virus is passed to larvae by infected adult nurse bees during feeding. Infected larvae may die shortly after capping, before they pupate. The larvae change from white, to yellow, and then brown. Larvae usually die in the cells with their heads facing up—the head and mouthparts usually turn black. The skin of the larvae hardens but the inside of the larvae becomes watery fluid-filled sac that can often be removed from the cell intact. The larvae may eventually dry out and form a loose scale that is easily removed from the cell. Adult bees may have shortened lifespans if they become infected with sacbrood virus. '),(19,'disease',1,'Deformed wing virus','Deformed wing virus','Deformed wing virus is one of the most widespread and common honey bee viruses in the world, and can be detected in the most apiaries in New Zealand. Work by the Ministry for Primary Industries has shown that New Zealand has the Deformed wing virus A (DWV-A) subtype, but no evidence of the Deformed wing virus B (DWV-B) subtype was found. Generally, around the world DWV-B has replaced DWV-A, and DWV-B has become the dominant subtype. There are conflicting scientific reports about which variant is worse. Despite being so common, most honey bee colonies are able to tolerate low levels of Deformed wing virus infection without suffering obvious ill effect, but transmission of this virus is greatly enhanced by the varroa mite.','Deformed wing virus is named after one of the main symptoms it can cause in adult honey bees – deformities of the wings. The virus can also have other effects on all life stages and castes of honey bees. It is one of over 24 viruses that are known to infect honey bees.',' shrivelled or greatly reduced wings, decreased body size and discoloration.'),(20,'pest',1,'Hymenoptera','Hymenoptera','The larvae of the Hymenoptera develop inside the body of the bee, consuming the bee\'s internal tissues and ultimately causing the bee\'s death.','The Hymenoptera is a natural enemy of honeybees. The adults capture adult bees at the entrance of the honeycomb or near the honeycomb and lay eggs in their bodies.','Infected bees may exhibit unusual flight behavior.\r\nThe number of adult bees in the colony decreases.'),(21,'pest',0,'Small Hive Beetle','Aethina tumida','The SHB can invade hives, where its larvae feed on honey, pollen, and bee brood. The beetles can cause fermented honey, which leads to the ruin of honeycombs and potentially the entire hive.','The Small Hive Beetle (SHB) is a beetle native to Africa that poses a threat to bee colonies. It has not been detected in New Zealand as of my last update, but it\'s a concern due to its destructive nature in other countries.\n','Signs of SHB infestation include damaged or destroyed combs, honey fermentation and spoilage, and an increase in hive humidity and messiness.'),(22,'disease',0,'Stonebrood','Stonebrood','The fungus invades the bee\'s body, consuming it from the inside and eventually killing the host. The disease thrives in environments with high humidity and can spread through the colony via spores.','Stonebrood is a fungal disease that affects both larvae and adult bees, caused by various species of the Aspergillus fungus.','Infected bees are found dead with a hard, stone-like outer layer that encases the body. This \"stone\" appearance gives the disease its name. Infected larvae and adults may be found both inside and outside the hive, indicating a severe infestation.'),(23,'disease',1,'Black queen cell virus','Black queen cell virus','Pathogen Type: BQCV is a virus that infects honeybees, with a particularly devastating effect on queen larvae and pupae.\r\nTransmission: The virus can be spread through direct contact between bees, as well as through the feeding of infected royal jelly to queen larvae by worker bees. Varroa mites have also been implicated in its transmission, although they are not necessary for the virus to spread.','BQCV primarily affects the cells of developing queen bees, causing the cells to turn black and ultimately leading to the death of the queen larvae. This occurrence can severely impact the reproductive success of a hive, as the production of healthy queens is crucial for colony survival and expansion. The virus can be present in a colony without causing noticeable symptoms until stress factors, such as poor nutrition or varroa mite infestation, exacerbate its effects.','In Queen Cells: The most distinctive sign of BQCV is the darkening of queen cells, which contain the developing queen larvae. The cells may appear blackened and may contain dead larvae that fail to develop properly.\r\nImpact on Colony: While BQCV primarily affects queen cells, its impact can lead to broader colony issues. Without a healthy queen to produce eggs, the colony may become queenless, leading to a lack of cohesion and productivity. Eventually, this can result in the weakening or collapse of the colony if a new, healthy queen is not reared or introduced promptly.'),(24,'pest',1,'Wax Moth','Achroia grisella and Galleria mellonella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae)','Habitat and Behavior: Wax moths can thrive in weak or abandoned hives but can also invade strong colonies. Adult moths lay eggs inside beehives, and the larvae are the primary cause of damage as they feed on the beeswax, honey, pollen, and even bee larvae.\r\nAdaptation: These moths have adapted to exploit the resources within beehives, making them persistent pests that can quickly colonize and damage unprotected or weakened hives.','Wax Moth refers to two primary species, the Greater Wax Moth (Galleria mellonella) and the Lesser Wax Moth (Achroia grisella), which pose significant threats to bee colonies primarily through their larval stages. These moths are known for their ability to infest beehives, where they cause destruction to the wax combs.','Wax moth are small and grey (10-19 mm long). Larvae have dark heads with several body segments. They create white, yellow and/or dark brown cocoons.'),(25,'pest',1,'Vespula Wasps','Vespa germanica (German wasp) and Vespa vulgaris (common wasp) (Vespidae: Hymenoptera)','Social Structure: Vespula wasps live in highly organized social colonies that include a single queen, male drones, and female workers. The colonies are seasonal in many climates, with new nests built each spring by overwintering queens.\r\nNesting Habits: These wasps typically construct paper nests made from chewed wood fibers mixed with saliva. Nests can be found underground, in cavities, or suspended in bushes and trees.\r\nDiet: Vespula wasps are omnivorous, feeding on insects, nectar, and human food waste. Their diet makes them both beneficial for natural pest control and nuisances when they scavenge near human activities.','Vespula Wasps, commonly known as yellow jackets or common wasps, are a genus of social wasps that can become significant pests to both humans and honeybees. They are particularly known for their distinctive yellow and black striped appearance and their ability to aggressively defend their nests.','German and common wasps look very similar.  They have spread throughout most of the country and are a significant pest of urban, rural, and native ecosystems.'),(32,'disease',0,'European Foulbrood','Melissococcus plutonius','The bacterium mostly affects a honey bee larva before pupation.  Larvae become infected after ingesting contaminated food. The bacterium then proliferates in the gut of larvae, competing for food which ultimately leads to death by starvation. EFB is often connected to colony stressors such as adverse weather conditions, seasonal change, and poor nutrition etc.','European foulbrood (EFB) is a brood disease of honey bees. it is caused by the bacterium Melissococcus plutonius. EFB can be found in most parts of the world where honey bees are kept.

These mites crawl down into the trachea, pierce their mouthparts into the lining, and then draw up the blood (hemolymph) from the bee. This causes damage to the airway of the bee and reduces their lifespan. These mites reproduce in the trachea and then emerge to be passed on to other bees. Tracheal mites usually cause dwindling of colonies, and this may occur at any time of year, but can be especially profound in spring when bees have been confined over winter. When mites first arrive in a country they can cause severe colony losses that can continue for many years. ','Tracheal mites (Acarapis woodi) are microscopic mites that invade the breathing tubes (trachea) of honey bees. These mites crawl down into the trachea, pierce their mouthparts into the lining, and then draw up the blood (hemolymph) from the bee. ','Signs of infestations in an apiary are extremely variable and are not specific. Some colonies show no obvious signs; while others may show the following symptoms:\r\n• large numbers of crawling bees at the entrance of the hive;\r\n• inability to fly;\r\n• disorientated bees;\r\n• a large number of bees remaining inside the hive;\r\n• “K” wings – bees holding their wings at odd angles;\r\n• drop in population;\r\n• spring losses.'),(36,'pest',0,'Tropilaelaps','Tropilaelaps','Tropilaelaps mites (pronounced: TRO PIL LAY LAPS) are native to Asia where they have evolved to parasitise the brood of the giant honey bees (Apis dorsata). There are four species of Tropilaelaps mites, none of which are present in New Zealand.\r\nTwo of these species, Tropilaelaps clareae and Tropilaelaps mercedesae can also feed on European honey bees and cause significant damage. These mites not only parasitise developing bees, but are capable of transmitting viruses, much like varroa mites. If Tropilaelaps mites were to establish in New Zealand they could cause significant colony losses, reduce honey production, and impact pollination. ','Tropilaelaps mites are native to Asia.

There are 4 species of Tropilaelaps mites. \r\n\r\nTwo of these species, Tropilaelaps clareae and Tropilaelaps mercedesae, can also feed on European honey bees and cause significant damage.','Tropilaelaps mites are smaller than varroa but can still be seen with the naked eye. They are about 1 mm in length and 0.5 mm across.  They have two pairs of four legs on each side of their body, with the front legs being held so they look like antennae.  The lifecycle of the mite is similar to varroa and is synchronised with that of the host bee. Four Tropilaelaps mites per cell is typical.  Tropilaelaps mite survival on adult bees is however short (1 – 2 days) as they cannot pierce the exoskeleton. Because of this, almost all Tropilaelaps are found in the brood. When the Tropilaelaps do emerge from brood cells, they almost immediately enter another brood cell, which makes their detection on adult bees difficult.  Parasitized bee larvae usually complete their development but emerge exhibiting damage similar to that caused by varroa.'),(37,'pest',0,'Braula','Braula coeca','The fly attaches itself to the thorax/ head region of a bee, where it intercepts nectar and pollen being fed during bee-to-bee feeding or trophallaxis. Because of this, the fly is most often found on the queen bee and drones as most feeding interactions happens within these castes. The fly is not considered to be a serious threat to beekeeping, as it does not damage or parasitize any stage of the honey bee lifecycle. However, its presence may reduce the productivity of the queen if infestation levels are high enough.','Braula (Braula coeca) is a wingless species of fly. It is incorrectly referred to as bee ‘louse’. The fly attaches itself to the thorax and head parts of a bee. It steals nectar and pollen that is fed during bee-to-bee feeding or trophallaxis.','The fly is small (0.9mm wide by 1.5mm long), red-brown, covered in hairs and has six legs. It lays small eggs throughout the hive, however, only those deposited on capped honey will hatch. Once hatched, the larvae tunnel under the capping’s leaving narrow 1mm wide tracks across the surface of the comb. This tunnelling gives honey comb a fractured appearance.\r\nBraula fly prefers queen bees but has also been observed to attach to drones and less commonly to workers.
